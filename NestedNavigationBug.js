This React Native code exhibits unexpected behavior when handling nested navigation within a TabNavigator.  Specifically, when navigating deeply within a nested stack, the parent screens sometimes fail to update correctly, leaving stale data or UI elements. This issue is particularly noticeable when using React Navigation's `useNavigation` hook or passing navigation props down through several layers of components.  The problem appears inconsistent and doesn't always reproduce in the same manner, making debugging challenging.
